RAD_Q64MA3
Flap endonuclease GEN-like 1; Endonuclease which cleaves flap structures at the junction between single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA. Possesses both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA-binding activities. Involved in early microspore development_ but does not alter meiosis or tapetal cells development. Possesses Holliday junction (HJ) resolvase activity in vitro. Cleaves HJ at symmetrically related sites of the branch point. Belongs to the XPG/RAD2 endonuclease family. GEN subfamily.
